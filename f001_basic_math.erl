-module(f001_basic_math).
-export([basic_math/0]).

%Note: 
%1. The name of module must match the name of file
%2. We need to export all the functions that we intend to call from outside
%   functions are listed in name/arity format (arity is number of arguments that function expects)
%3. If we are practicing then we can export all functions using
%      -compile(export_all).



%This function performs basic arithmetic and prints results
basic_math() ->

			%io:format is used to print values. ~p gets replaced with value from list supplied
			%as second argument. ~n is for newline. ~p is for pretty print. One can use
			%     erl -man io
			%to get man page of io module and lookup help for format module to understand 
			%options other than ~p and ~n
		io:format("1. Simple addition - ~p~n", [2+3]),

			%Integer arithmetic in erlang is exact so one never has to worry about overflow
		io:format("2. Multiplication of very big integers - ~p~n", [2234234234 * 234234234234234]),

			%Integers can be written in any base from 2 to 36. The format of writing integers
			%with base other than 10 is 'base#number'
		io:format("3. Integers in other base are - ~p and ~p~n", [16#cafe, 32#sugar]),

			%We can get ASCII value of characters as integers by preceeding character
			%with $ sign
		io:format("4. ASCII value of a and A are ~p and ~p respectively~n", [$a, $A]),
			
			%Integer division
		io:format("5. Integer division 5/3=~p~n", [5/3]),

			%Float division
		io:format("6. Float division 5.0/3.0=~p~n", [5.0/3.0]),

			%Remainder of divison
		io:format("7. Remainder of divison 5/3=~p~n", [5 rem 3]),

			%Quotient of divison
		io:format("8. Quotient of divison 5/3=~p~n", [5 div 3]),

			%Value of last expression is returned as value of function call. Last statement
			%of function ends with . and not with ,   dot(.) helps in indicating end of function
			%definition.
		ok.
	



%To run the program start erlang runtime environment with 
%    erl
%in same directory as the current example. Then on erlang prompt use:
%    erlc(f001_basic_math).
%to compile the program. If compilation returns ok and not error then use
%    f001_basic_math:basic_math().
%to run the program and see results.
