	L2 = lists:map(fun(X) -> 2*X end, L1),

	%Creating list of fruits
	Fruits1 = [{apple, 3}, {orange, 4}, {banana, 1}, {grapes, 23}],
	
	%Doubling number of each fruit using list comprehension
	%Note that now we are extracting tuples from list and generating
	%List with tuples
	Fruits2 = [{Fruit, Quantity*2} || {Fruit, Quantity} <- Fruits1],
	io:format("2. Fruits1 and Fruits2 are ~p~n    and ~p~n", [Fruits1, Fruits2]),

	
	%We can add filter statements to list compresions
	Fruits3 = [{Fruit, Quantity} || {Fruit, Quantity} <- Fruits1, Quantity < 5],
	io:format("3. Fruits with less than 5 quantity are ~p~n", [Fruits3]),

	%Here,
	%  {Fruit, Quantity} is called constructor
	%  {Fruit, Quantity} <- Fruits1 is called generator
	%  Quantity < 5 is called filter.
	%It is important to understand that generators can also act as filters
    %as shown below

	First_a = [{a, B} || {a, B} <- [{a, 1}, {aa, 1}, {a, 3}, {b, 5}, "hello", {a, b, c}]],

	ok.
